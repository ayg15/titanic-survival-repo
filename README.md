# Predicting passenger survival on Titanic
For this we will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle.
We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased. 
We will implement Logistic Regression in Python for classification for predicting the survival and we will use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set.
